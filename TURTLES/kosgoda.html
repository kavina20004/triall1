        <p>This hatchery strives to make great attempts to preserve and protect turtles by helping to enhance the process of hatching and ensuring safe survival of baby turtles after hatching. <br> 

          They also provide care and treatment of injured or sick adult turtles and then releasing them back into the seas. <br> 

          They also conduct workshops and programs creating awareness among foreign visitors and locals.<br> 
          The groundwork of the hatchery revolves around inspecting the beach at night for any eggs that have been laid or mother turtles coming ashore to lay their eggs,<br>
           in which they are sheltered and shifted to the hatchery centre to prevent them from attack from predators or inhumane activity.  <br>

          The Turtle hatchery at Kosgoda is an amazing place of learning and it is full of fun since it is for the full family. Visit the hatchery and help feed the turtles and if during the season, you may be able to encounter a first hand experience in releasing the babies into the water.
