    <hr><br>
 
    <p>Sea turtles also referred to as Chelonioidea.
      In Sinhala, sea turtles are referred to as Kesbawa.<br>
      Turtles are rarely seen because they live under water and only the females come ashore,<br>
      they are rarely seen. Moreover they only do so at night. <br>
      Five of the seven species of the existing sea turtles in the world visit the shores of Sri Lanka.<br>
      They are Green turtle  , Hawksbill Turtle , Olive Ridley , Loggerhead and the Leatherback

      <h2>Turtle Hatcheries</h2>
       <p>The site where the sea turtles swim and come back to hatch their eggs is called a turtle hatchery<br><br>
        They enter from the Indian Ocean by swimming, then they pull themselves up the sand on the beaches close to Galle, where they dig their nests and lay their eggs.<br><br>
        Turtles often lay more than 100 eggs, enough to maintain the species.The remainder are mostly eaten by predators which survive of those species.
        Turtles have long placed their eggs in Sri Lanka's southern shore.<br><br>
        Their young should hatch a few weeks later and migrate to the ocean and the shore.<br><br></p>
