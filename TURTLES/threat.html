        <h1>Threat to the turtles</h1><hr>
        <br> <br>
        <p>Over the past 200 years humans have shifted the odds against the survival of these species<br>
          Sea turtles are killed for their flesh, eggs skin, shells and they are victims to poaching <br>
          Turtles also suffer from habitat loss and accidental capture<br>
          Six of the seven species of sea turtles are considered endangered as a result of human behavior <br>
          There are many ways that people harm these creatures, <br>
          from people consuming their flesh and eggs to becoming trapped in fishing gear and many more.. </p>

      <h2>Entanglement in fishing gear and Pollution</h2>
      <p>Turtles get hurt by bomb fishing, in shrimp nets, and on long lines<br>
        Sea turtles including green loggerhead olive Ridley and leatherback are drawn to the bait and end up getting hooked up or drowning after becoming tangled in the lines of hooks. <br><br>
        It is estimated that thousand turtles die per year because of entanglement in plastic<br>
        A large population of sea turtles are endangered every year because of pollution in the oceans. </p>    
        <h2> How can we prevent this ?</h2>
        <p>Participate in coastal cleanups and reduce the use of plastic to keep the ocean clean.educe marine debris that may entangle or be accidentally eaten by sea turtles<br>

      <h2>Coastal Development</h2>
      <p>Coastal development is a broad category which includes an array of human activities <br>
        including beachfront construction of houses,hotels,restaurants and roads often for tourism. This affects the nesting of female sea turtles
        Constructions can also cause pollution from litter and runoff which pollutes the nearest show where the sea turtle’s mate.<br><br>
         It can also affect pollution of the ocean and cause problems for many marine creatures<br></p>
        
        <h2> How can we prevent this ?</h2>
        <p>Sea walls on or adjacent nesting beaches can prevent this from happening,<br>
          When constructed they should be located as far landward and away from the nesting beach as possible<br>
          what we as citizens can help is by not building houses close the shore 
          Help promote coastal construction policies<br>
