       <h3>Where is it located ?</h3><br><br>
       <p>The Sea Turtle Hatchery and Rescue Center, which preserves some of the world's endangered turtle species,<br>
         is located a few kilometers away from Hikkaduwa town.<br><br>
          It is only one of the numerous turtle hatcheries along the island's shore.</p>
       <br><br><br>

       <h3>About it</h3><br><br>
       <p>It began as a community effort to help save the southern coast’s biodiversity,
         but it has now developed into a full-fledged hatchery and rescue facility with devoted crews who toil around the clock to research,
          look after and safeguard many turtle species.<br><br>
        Modern water tanks are included in the facilities at the sea turtle hatchery and rescue center <br>
        which also cares for adult species that has been pulled from the water after suffering major injuries.<br><br>
        The place where the turtles lay their eggs which has small mounds of sand heaped between one another,
        <br>is one of the wonderful sites in the center.</p>
        
        <br><br><br>

       <h3>Things you can do there</h3><br><br>
       <p>The hatchery provides a space to the injured turtles and their eggs.<br><br>
          Learn the process of collecting the eggs or baby turtles from the shore that are taken for protection and experience in holding the turtles or feeding them.<br>
          if during the season, you might get the opportunity to release the baby turtles that are ready to go back into the ocean.
